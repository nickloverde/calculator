- I used a lot of comments on this one, which are probably over kill in general practice but helped me clarify why everything was needed and what I was specifically doing with my code.

- On the CSS front I learned more about working with grids. Specifically, how to condense grids and use the minmax.

- I overloaded this one with comments, that I would not do normally, but really wanted to go over the code again and again and identify, which each section was doing.

- There were many firsts for this project. Specifically, my first time using the JavaScript "this.", JavaScript class, and using "data" structure for the HTML.
